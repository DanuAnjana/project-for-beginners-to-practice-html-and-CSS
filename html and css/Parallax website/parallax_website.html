            <h2>Section One</h2>
            <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not 
                artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all 
                living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity.In contrast to the natural 
                environment is the built environment. In such areas where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and
                 agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem
                less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one.
                Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works 
                of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.<br>

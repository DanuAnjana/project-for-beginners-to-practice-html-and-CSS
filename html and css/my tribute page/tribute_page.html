                <p>Chief Seattle (c. 1786 – June 7, 1866) was a Suquamish and Duwamish chief.
                     A leading figure among his people, he pursued a path of accommodation to white settlers, 
                     forming a personal relationship with "Doc" Maynard. The city of Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington,
                      was named after him. A widely publicized speech arguing in favor of ecological responsibility and respect of 
                      Native Americans' land rights had been attributed to him. <br>
                    
                    <br>Seattle was born some time between 1780 and 1786 on the Black River near Kent,
                    Washington. One source cites his mother's name as Wood-sho-lit-sa.
                   The Duwamish tradition is that Seattle was born at his mother's village 
                   of stukw on the Black River, in what is now the city of Kent, Washington, 
                   and that Seattle grew up speaking both the Duwamish and Suquamish dialects of Lushootseed. 
                   Because Native descent among the Salish peoples was not solely patrilineal, Seattle inherited 
                   his position as chief of the Duwamish Tribe from his maternal uncle.
                   Seattle earned his reputation at a young age as a leader and a warrior,
                   ambushing and defeating groups of tribal enemy raiders coming up the Green River 
                  from the Cascade foothills. In 1847, he helped lead a Suquamish attack upon the
                   Chimakum people near Port Townsend, which effectively wiped out the Chimakum.<br>
                  
                  
                   <br>Like many of his contemporaries, he owned slaves captured during his raids.
                   He was tall and broad, standing nearly six feet (1.8 m) tall; Hudson's Bay 
                  Company traders gave him the nickname Le Gros (The Big Guy). He was also known as 
                  an orator; and when he addressed an audience, his voice is said to have carried from
                   his camp to the Stevens Hotel at First and Marion, a distance of 3/4 mile (1.2 km).<br>
                  
                  
                   <br>Chief Seattle took wives from the village of Tola'ltu just southeast of Duwamish
                   Head on Elliott Bay (now part of West Seattle). His first wife La-Dalia died after
                   bearing a daughter. He had three sons and four daughters with his second wife, Olahl.
                   The most famous of his children was his first, Kikisoblu or Princess Angeline. 
                  Seattle was converted to Christianity by French missionaries, and was baptized 
                  in the Roman Catholic Church, with the baptismal name Noah, probably in 1848 near Olympia, Washington.<br>
                  
                  
                  <br>For all his skill, Seattle was gradually losing ground to the more powerful 
                  Patkanim of the Snohomish when white settlers started showing up in force around 1850. 
                  (In later years, Seattle claimed to have seen the ships of the Vancouver Expedition
                   as they explored Puget Sound in 1792.) When his people were driven from their
                   traditional clamming grounds, Seattle met Doc Maynard in Olympia; they formed a
                   friendly relationship useful to both. Persuading the settlers at the white settlement 
                  of Duwamps to rename their town Seattle, Maynard established their support for Chief
                   Seattle's people and negotiated relatively peaceful relations with the tribes.<br>
                  
                   <br>Seattle kept his people out of the Battle of Seattle in 1856. Afterwards,
                   he was unwilling to lead his tribe to the reservation established, 
                  since mixing Duwamish and Snohomish was likely to lead to bloodshed.
                   Maynard persuaded the government of the necessity of allowing Seattle
                   to remove to his father's longhouse on Agate Passage, 'Old Man House' or Tsu-suc-cub.
                   Seattle frequented the town named after him, and had his photograph taken by E. M. Sammis in 1865.
                   He died June 7, 1866, on the Suquamish reservation at Port Madison, Washington.
